## 👋 Hi there 

📍 I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and have spent the majority of my career at American Express. Over the course of 15 years, I have had a strong focus on the Resource Planning Center, specializing in forecasting, business engineering, project analysis, and team leadership. This experience has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of optimizing processes and driving efficiency within the organization.

🛠 Five years ago, I made a conscious decision to challenge myself and reignite an old passion from my past. That's when I dove back into the world of frontend development. With a renewed sense of purpose, I dedicated myself to honing my skills in usability and pixel-perfect design. Drawing from my previous experience, I seamlessly transitioned into this role and quickly found myself immersed in the art of coding and creating visually stunning websites and applications.

🚀 Fuelled by my passion for technology, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. 

📃 I am not only dedicated to my formal studies in System Analysis(DaVinci University) but also engage in self-directed learning, always exploring new technologies and methodologies. This drive for growth, coupled with my natural inclination for dynamic environments, fuels my desire to continually challenge myself and deliver a "wow" effect to clients.

🌟The coding mindset has become an integral part of my life. From daily tasks to life's challenges, I'm a strong believer that if there are variables involved, there is always room for improvement and the potential to find solutions. You only need to research, implement, test, and repeat it again, until you achieve your goal.

💼 Currently working for Clarika Software with an amazing client Saffire LLC, in frontend tasks, providing support for themes and sites development, and global platform UI tasks.
